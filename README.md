### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Overall, yes. We were introduced to React and the main parts of a React website. For example, components, state, APIs, and hooks and they all were shown in the project. However, I still felt unprepared for certain parts. Of course some of the stretch features like sort, and embedded youtube because we did not directly discuss that so it was a challenge as expected. However, some of the fetch and async/await I had trouble with and getting the info to show up from the API was a challenge at first since it was not exactly how we did in the labs but still very very closely related so they were helpful.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would have not asked for as much help from instructors and peers and spent more time reseaerching and watching videos. Basically just getting 100% familiar and comfortable with the content. However, because of the time constraints I learned enough to get by but I fear I don't feel 100% confident.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I did not demo this time. My peers had very nice styling, I want to do more research on styling next time and go beyond what we learned in the Codepath class for future projects. Styling can make a "boring" site have more of an appeal even if the actual features never changed.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Shoutout to Reena for helping me out when she finished her project. Shoutout to every single one of the TF's and instructors in Cohort 1 for helping me debug and get a clearer understanding on this week's topics.
